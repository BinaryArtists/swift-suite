            Starting in iOS 8, you can optionally create actionable notifications by registering custom actions for
            a notification type. When an actionable notification arrives, the system creates a button for each
            registered action and adds those buttons to the notification interface. 
            These action buttons give the user a quick way to perform tasks related to the notification. 
            For example, a remote notification for a meeting invite might offer actions to accept or decline the meeting.
            When the user taps one of your action buttons, the system notifies your app, giving you an opportunity to
            perform the corresponding task.

        *   The first time an app calls the registerUserNotificationSettings: method, iOS prompts the user to
            allow the specified interactions. On subsequent launches, calling this method does not prompt the user.
            After you call the method, iOS reports the results asynchronously to the
            application:didRegisterUserNotificationSettings: method of your app delegate.
            The first time you register your settings, iOS waits for the user’s response before calling this method,
            but on subsequent calls it returns the existing user settings.

            If the user disallows specific notification types, avoid using those types when configuring local and
